<p>Q: What are CSS grid and Flexbox? When should you use one over the other</p>
<p> Flex box allows for things to be automatically aligned and spaced. Such as navigation bars and things of that nature. Grid can be like a "spreadsheet" where it has various cells in a grid like format. This allows for things to be precise</p>
